suggestions for improvement:
- The frontend stores the access token in `localStorage`, which violates the instruction to store it in the Redux store and not in `localStorage`.
- The backend lacks input sanitization in several places beyond password hashing.  Always sanitize user inputs before using them in database queries or other sensitive operations to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Error handling could be more robust and informative.  Provide more specific error messages to the client, without revealing sensitive information.
- The `refreshAccessToken` function in the backend does not check if the refresh token is valid or has expired, before signing a new accessToken.
- Improve the performance of database queries. Use appropriate indexes and optimize queries for better efficiency. Use query builder for more efficient queries.
- The frontend's handling of error messages could be improved. Consider using a more user-friendly approach to display errors, potentially with clear visual feedback.
- Implement more comprehensive testing for the authentication and authorization logic. Use unit tests, integration tests etc.
- The project lacks documentation explaining how to start the project, environment variables etc. Add a README.md file with instructions on how to run the application and set up the database.
